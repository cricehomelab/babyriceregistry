        Renee Ellis and Charlie Rice III welcomed the newest member of the family into the world on ***DATE***!
      </p>
      <p class="center">
        Weighing in at ## pounds and ## ounces. We think you will agree that he is cute as a button.

      <p class="center">
        We are happy to announce the whole family is happy and healthy, but a little bit tired. We'd like to 
        thank everyone for their love and support we could not have been successful in bringing this little guy 
        into the world without you.
